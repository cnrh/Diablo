Base idea:
    Your npc spawns in at the normal 0,0 to which it has a camera as a bat that follows it
    The bat follows via. everytime you click your cursor in the map it'll teleport to the npc,
        while it is pathfinding to the clicked spot.
    The player rides the bat AND spectates it.
    A cursor spawns as a certain entity (not decided/just make it a snowball)
        The cursor moves based on player rotation packet

    There are bases with npcs
        when talking to an npc you look at it and it does dialogue
        how dialogue works is tbd

    There are teleport pads that u can click and view a map to teleport to.
        Would be cool to make it show a map with a seperate cursor that you can hover over certain things to click to teleport
        Or just make it a gui

    Make the default spawn a base camp with a teleport pad in the middle that lights up when you hover over it with your cursor
        ex. when hovering, instead of selector being a shulker box at the block, its a interaction thats the size of the teleport pad

    Make the player display name hidden and show seperate armor stand information

    Make it so when you hover over another npc they start glowing and u click to view their info

    Make it so when you join/leave it broadcasts join leave messages

    Import into minehut and test
